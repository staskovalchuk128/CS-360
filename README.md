<h4>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?</h4>
The Inventory Application requires functionalities enabling users to register, authenticate, manage item additions or removals, and receive text notifications when products are out of stock or their quantity reaches zero.
<h4>What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?</h4>
The initial screen will feature login and sign-up options, allowing users to register new accounts for system access. Upon user verification, access to the inventory system will be granted. The inventory system will facilitate entry of item details such as name, description and quantity of the product.
<h4>How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?</h4>
As I was new to Android development, I invested considerable time in researching how to effectively implement functions like SQLite databases, alert dialogs, and lists. This experience taught me valuable problem-solving skills and highlighted the significance of research in system development, particularly when tackling unfamiliar subjects.
<h4>How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?</h4>
Following any modifications or additions to the codebase, I ensure to execute the application and meticulously inspect for potential errors or anomalies. Additionally, leveraging breakpoints and debugging proves instrumental in pinpointing the origins and nature of encountered errors.
<h4>Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?</h4>
When I started putting all the parts of the project together and creating a database, I tried to create a convenient class that would send queries to the database. This class has a function that takes a string as an SQL argument and executes it.
<h4>In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?</h4>
As I said earlier, the Java class that I created for database queries, in my opinion, successfully demonstrates my knowledge and skills that I gained in this course.
